Our approach can handle multiple sources in large virtual environments with complex occlusion, and can produce plausible acoustic effects at an interactive rate on a desktop PC. We introduce a new metric based on the signalto-noise ratio (SNR) of the energy response and use this metric to evaluate the performance of ray-tracing-based acoustic simulation methods. Our formulation exploits temporal coherence in terms of using the resulting sample distribution of the previous frame to guide the sample distribution of the current one. We show that our sample redistribution algorithm converges and better balances between early and late reflections. We evaluate our approach on different benchmarks and demonstrate significant speedup over prior geometric acoustic algorithms.},

            This paper proposes a new approach for calculating the impulse response of room acoustics. Impulse response provides unique characterization of any discrete lineartime invariant (LTI) systems. We assume that the room is a linear time-invariant system and the impulse response is calculated simply by sending a Dirac Impulse into the system as input and getting the response from the output. Then, the output of the system is represented as a sum of time-shifted weighted impulse responses. Both mathematical justifications for the proposed method and results from simulation software developed to evaluate the proposed approach are presented in detail.},
