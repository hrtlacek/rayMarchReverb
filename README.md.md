## Touchdesigner
The TouchDesigner example application requires the installation of Derivative TouchDesigner. This has been tested with build [Windows, 64-Bit,2020.22080](https://download.derivative.ca/TouchDesigner.2020.22080.exe). Beware that backwards compatibility is not TouchDesigner's strength, so better download that specific version although newer versions might work.
